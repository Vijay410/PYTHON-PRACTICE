# ARRAY DATA STRUCTURE : Lets Learn About Arrays data Structure

* Arrays data structure is collection of item store data in contigeous memory location.
* Arrays holds the same type of data
* Two type of Arrays 1. Single Dimension 2. Multi Dimension

# Arrays Operation:
1. Insertion: Inserting an element into an array involves shifting existing elements to make space for the new element, which can be inefficient for large arrays.

2. Deletion: Deleting an element from an array involves shifting remaining elements to close the gap left by the deleted element.

3. Traversal: Iterating over all elements of the array to perform some operation on each element.

4. Searching: Finding the index of a specific element in the array. Common search algorithms 

5. Sorting: Arranging the elements of the array in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort.

# Multi-dimensional Arrays: 
Arrays can have multiple dimensions, such as 2D arrays (matrices) or higher-dimensional arrays. Elements in multi-dimensional arrays are accessed using multiple indices.

# Applications
Arrays are used in various applications, including:

Storing and manipulating collections of data.
Implementing data structures such as stacks, queues, and matrices.

# Static and Dynamic Arrays
 Static arrays and dynamic arrays are both data structures used for storing collections of elements, but they differ in their size flexibility and memory management.

# Static Array:
* Fixed Size:
    Static arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements they can hold is determined at the time of declaration and cannot be changed during runtime.

* Memory Allocation:
    Memory for static arrays is allocated at compile time, typically on the stack or in the data segment of the program.

# Dynamic Array:
* Resizable:
    Dynamic arrays can resize themselves dynamically during runtime to accommodate a varying number of elements. They can grow or shrink as needed.

* Memory Allocation:
    Memory for dynamic arrays is typically allocated on the heap. When the array needs to resize, additional memory is allocated or deallocated as required.
