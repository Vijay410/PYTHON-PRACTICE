# ARRAY DATA STRUCTURE : Lets Learn About Arrays data Structure

* Arrays data structure is collection of item store data in contigeous memory location.
* Arrays holds the same type of data
* Two type of Arrays 1. Single Dimension 2. Multi Dimension

# Arrays Operation:
1. Insertion: Inserting an element into an array involves shifting existing elements to make space for the new element, which can be inefficient for large arrays.

2. Deletion: Deleting an element from an array involves shifting remaining elements to close the gap left by the deleted element.

3. Traversal: Iterating over all elements of the array to perform some operation on each element.

4. Searching: Finding the index of a specific element in the array. Common search algorithms 

5. Sorting: Arranging the elements of the array in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort.


# Multi-dimensional Arrays: 
Arrays can have multiple dimensions, such as 2D arrays (matrices) or higher-dimensional arrays. Elements in multi-dimensional arrays are accessed using multiple indices.

# Applications
Arrays are used in various applications, including:

Storing and manipulating collections of data.
Implementing data structures such as stacks, queues, and matrices.
